## INTRODUTION

- This Project contains a python file to detect hands and Draw different Shapes and pencil with different Colours to draw
- Who wants to use it in his/her project for detection hands and count fingers and drawing.
- This Module uses mainly openCV (cv2) library of python for video and other detections

- ***First You need to install some modules to run this file***





## Installation

Go to your Cmd or Python Shell or Anaconda Prompt (if using spyder or Jupyter)

**You need to install 1 Libraries**
- OpenCV (cv2)
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

Once it is installed you are good to run the Script or can call it in your own project
:thumsup:

**This Project needs a Hand Detection File which is porvided in the project or you can download from**
```bash
https://github.com/VedantRaj3907/Hand-Detection-And-Tracking-Module-Python-OpenCV
```

- Or You can just write this line of code to import in your Counting_Fingers.py file (if not presented)
```bash
 import HandDetectionModule as htm
```

- If you want to import the Counting_Fingers.py file in your own porject make sure you got both **Counting_Fingers.py** file and **HandDetectionModule.py** file and just write this code in your project Script
***Note :- Both of the files must be at the same path as your project file***
```bash
 import Counting_Fingers
```
- Or can get the Counting Fingers Project from
```bash
 https://github.com/VedantRaj3907/Counting-Number-of-Open-Fingers-Hand-Detection-Python-OPenCV
